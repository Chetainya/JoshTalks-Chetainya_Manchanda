Soring Logic : 

The filterAndSortTasks function sorts tasks first by completion status, placing incomplete tasks before completed ones. If two tasks have the same completion status, they are sorted by priority, with higher-priority tasks (e.g., "High") appearing before lower-priority ones (e.g., "Medium" or "Low").
